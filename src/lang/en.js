    about_me_p2: "I studied computer science 🎓, but real learning came from hands-on experience 😉. To keep growing and for the fun of it, I dive into new things – blockchain, game development, simple mobile apps📱 – basically anything that grabs my curiosity and expands my horizons.",
    about_me_p3: "After work 💻, I stay active and work on self-improvement – reading, hitting the gym, cycling, a bit of football and running, and even some meditation 🧘‍♂️. I also like to stay in the loop with what's going on in the world, so I follow market 📉 and political news.",
    about_me_p4: "I can work independently, I'm an introvert 🫣 and I value peace and quiet. Of course, I enjoy work and interacting with people – it can even be fun – but in that mode, my batteries tend to drain a bit faster 😅.",
